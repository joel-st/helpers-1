Using SVG graphics as background images with a PNG fallback
===========================================================

Any browser which supports multiple background image definitions in CSS can also work with SVG graphics.
We can use this to our advantage when allowing the browser to decide whether to show a PNG or an SVG image.

Example code: see index.html. Note that IE8 and older doesn't support background-size correctly
so make sure that you create your PNG images in the exact size in which you want them to appear.

GENERAL NOTE
Vectors & Software: 
All digital material included on the data carrier has been hand-crafted by Neubau. To ensure an optimal balance of file size with illustrative quality, the number of anchor points used in each illustration was kept to a minimum. Nevertheless, some very detailed vector objects (e.g. rulers, trees) contain over 83.000 anchor points. Such objects cannot be opened in vector editing software which imposes a lower limit on the permitted number of anchor points.

## Preprocessor Logos

A collection of single-colour, vector preprocessor logos, a la [Browser Logos](https://github.com/alrra/browser-logos).

At [Chloi Inc.](http://chloi.io), we work with preprocessors pretty frequently. We even built a static web server with some of the best preprocessors build in: [it’s called Harp](http://github.com/sintaxi/harp). This repo contains the logos we collected and recreated for [the Harp website](http://harpjs.com). We hope it’s helpful.

### Contributing

Looking to contribute? That’s awesome! Here’s some extensions to the project we would happily accept help with:

- Autoprefixer logo (yeah, it’s technically a _post-processor_, but whatever)
- Colour and knockout (white on a transparent background) vector versions of each logo
- The addition of your favourite absent preprocessor, as long as it’s being actively used by the community and the logo is in the same format as the others
- Any SVG cleanup other than minifying (it might be possible to optimised the viewboxes, for example)

Thanks for considering contributing, and feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/chloi/preprocessor-logos) if you have any questions.

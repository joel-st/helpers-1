Storing serialized form values in client localStorage using JavaScript and jQuery
=================================================================================

This example stores all of the values contained in forms within the grey <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt> in localStorage, on every instance of the keyup event within the grey <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt>.

(The stored JSON string is output to the textarea for demonstration purposes.)

As with all <tt>localStorage</tt> features, this needs JavaScript!.

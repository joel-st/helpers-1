#500px grid layout using CSS Flexbox

The code in this example is a simple mutation of the original JavaScript-based Angular solution coded by [xieranmaya](https://github.com/xieranmaya/) on Github. He's written an **extensive** blog post about it [here](https://github.com/xieranmaya/blog/issues/6).

Why is this version without JavaScript and Angular? Because if the page is delivered from a server running PHP, there's no need to over-complicate it by introducing JavaScript. This non-JavaScript version loads just as quickly and any links on the images will be read and indexed by Google without any problems.

Check out the source code of this PHP file to see how easy it is. The true magic lies in the CSS Flexbox code.

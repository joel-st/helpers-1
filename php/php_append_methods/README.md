Dynamically append new methods to a PHP class at runtime
========================================================

Does what it says on the tin. An understanding of magic functions and OOP in PHP is essential.

Usage
-----
Load additional class functionality on request. Magic function `__call` MUST BE USED.

The function `extend` looks for a file with the name e.g. class.winter.php in the same folder as the calling class. The second file must contain a class called e.g. Winter (i.e. all lowercase but with upper case first letter).

See makeVehicle.php for example usage.

    		<h2>What?</h2>
    		<p>The content column is limited to 720px. By giving the image blocks a class <code>full-width</code>, these stretch to the outside limit of the browser window, as they are set to <code>width:100vw</code>.</p>
    		<p>The images are then centred within the <code>div</code>.</p>

    		<p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin<sup>1</sup>, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V268Qk6-xsw">Hokey religions and ancient weapons</a> are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

    		<p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi">my old master</a>. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
    		<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. You don't believe in the Force, do you? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>

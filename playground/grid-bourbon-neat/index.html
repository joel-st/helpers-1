	<h1>Bourbon Neat grid system</h1>
	<p>Bourbon is pre-installed within Codekit, so you only need to call <code>@import "bourbon", "neat";</code> in your Sass file. This makes the grid mixins available for your own code.</p>
	<p>Bourbon's documentation is <a href="http://thoughtbot.github.io/neat-docs/latest/">here</a> and its own grid layout examples are <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/examples/">here</a>.</p>
	<p>The SCSS file in this folder is commented to explain how it is implemented.</p>

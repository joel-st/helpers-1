# WordPress plugin example code

This folder contains snippets and code examples for use when coding WordPress plugins. Because much of the code uses
[PHP namespaces](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php), it will only run in environments using PHP 5.3 or newer. 
There's a great article at [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/05/how-to-use-autoloading-and-a-plugin-container-in-wordpress-plugins/) 
on how to implement namespaces and class autoloading for use in WordPress.
